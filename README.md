# Iris-Flower-Classification

Iris Flower Classification is a classic machine learning problem that involves categorizing iris flowers into one of three species based on certain features extracted from their petals and sepals. This problem is often used as a beginner's introduction to supervised machine learning and classification techniques.

The dataset used for Iris Flower Classification is known as the Iris dataset or Fisher's Iris dataset, named after the British statistician and biologist Ronald A. Fisher, who collected and introduced it in 1936. The dataset consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, with 50 samples from each of three different species:

1. **Iris Setosa:** This species is characterized by its relatively small size, distinctive appearance, and relatively short petals and sepals. It's often considered the easiest to classify.

2. **Iris Versicolor:** Iris versicolor has moderately sized petals and sepals and is typically larger than Iris setosa. It is distinguishable by its unique color patterns.

3. **Iris Virginica:** Iris virginica has the largest petals and sepals among the three species and is known for its robust and elegant appearance.

For each iris flower in the dataset, the following four features are recorded:

1. **Sepal Length (in centimeters)**
2. **Sepal Width (in centimeters)**
3. **Petal Length (in centimeters)**
4. **Petal Width (in centimeters)**

The goal of Iris Flower Classification is to build a machine learning model that can predict the correct species of iris flower based on these four features. This is typically framed as a supervised classification problem, where the species label (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica) is the target variable, and the four features are the input variables.

Common machine learning algorithms used for Iris Flower Classification include:

1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)**
3. **Decision Trees**
4. **Random Forests**
5. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
6. **Neural Networks**

To evaluate the performance of the classification model, the dataset is often divided into a training set and a test set. The model is trained on the training set and then tested on the unseen data in the test set to assess its accuracy and generalization capability.

Iris Flower Classification is an essential exercise for learning about data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation. It serves as a foundational example in machine learning and data science education due to its simplicity and the availability of the dataset for experimentation.
